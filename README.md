<h1>Calcium Paint Masterpiece: Creating Artistry with Science and Sustainability</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to the world of Calcium Paint, where artistry meets eco-friendliness! 🌿🖌️</p>
<p>Imagine a machine that can craft high-quality paint autonomously, harnessing calcium extracted from factory exhaust to elevate the brilliance and longevity of the final masterpiece. No more guesswork, no more inconsistencies - just pure, consistent, and dazzling colors.</p>

<h2>Mission 🌟</h2>
<p>Our mission? To revolutionize the art of painting while championing sustainability. We're transforming carbon emissions into vibrant, long-lasting colors that can withstand the test of time and elements. Let's paint a greener future, one stroke at a time! 🌈🌍</p>

<h2>Crafting Brilliance 🎨</h2>
<h4>How it Works</h4>
<p>Our ingenious prototype is divided into three levels of creativity.</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>The Ingredients:</strong> On the first level, we house the magic - containers for paint, water (for that perfect viscosity), limestone, and primary colors - red, green, and blue.</li>
    <li><strong>The Alchemy:</strong> The Product container, nestled on the second level, is where the artistic alchemy takes place. With the grace of an Arduino microcontroller, the precision of C++ programming, and an embedded system, it dances with colors, adjusting viscosity, and quality like a true virtuoso.</li>
    <li><strong>Sustainability at Heart:</strong> And guess what? It's got a heart! A safety precaution ensures it won't overflow, and it's always in tune with its limits.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>The Maestro's Baton</strong></p>
<p>Connected to a central computer, this Maestro of the machine showcases volume, color, and viscosity in harmony. It's the ultimate symphony for factory workers and artists alike, thanks to the Feedback Control System powered by Java programming.</p>

<h2>Technologies Used 🌐</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Arduino microcontroller:</strong> To automate the paint mixing process, ensuring consistency and precision.</li>
    <li><strong>C++ programming language:</strong> For fine-tuning and control of color, viscosity, and quality adjustments, guaranteeing high-quality paint.</li>
    <li><strong>Embedded systems:</strong> To seamlessly integrate and manage the machine's operation, making it user-friendly and efficient.</li>
    <li><strong>Java programming language:</strong> To create the Feedback Control System, providing users with real-time information on volume, color, viscosity, and compliance with design specifications.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Brushstrokes of Progress 🌟</h2>
<h4>Results</h4>
<p>Our journey had its ups and downs, but we are painting the canvas of progress with every stroke.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Trial 1:</strong> The limestone dream didn't quite take off, achieving only 1 gm/liter due to a CO2 leak. The colors were off-key, but the journey had just begun.</li>
    <li><strong>Trial 2:</strong> We replaced the tubes, got an accurate color sensor, and achieved 5.6 gm/liter limestone, giving our palette a boost.</li>
    <li><strong>Trial 3:</strong> Even more limestone, but with added viscosity. An emergency bottle with more limestone became our saving grace.</li>
    <li><strong>Trial 4:</strong> A flawless masterpiece! 7.6 gm/liter of limestone, pure reds, and balanced viscosity. We've hit the sweet spot of brilliance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion 🎉</h2>
<p>The Calcium Paint project is more than just paint; it's a masterpiece in the making. We're reshaping the canvas of sustainability, one brushstroke at a time.</p>
